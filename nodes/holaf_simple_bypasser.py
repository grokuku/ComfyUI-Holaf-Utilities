HolafSimpleBypasser — Reactive bypasser node.

Unlike HolafRemote (which *initiates* group synchronization), this node is a
*reactive* bypasser: it listens for group state changes pushed by the JS layer
via the ``syncGroupState`` mechanism and never initiates synchronization itself.

The node exposes three widgets on the Python side:

* ``group_name`` — the name of the group this node reacts to.
* ``invert``    — when True, the node's ``active`` state is inverted relative
                  to the group's state (i.e. the node is active when the group
                  is OFF and vice-versa).
* ``active``    — stores the current group state received via sync. This widget
                  is declared here for serialization purposes but is **hidden**
                  on the JS side; its value is driven exclusively by
                  ``syncGroupState``.

The node also accepts an optional ``input`` of any type so it can be wired into
the graph as a pass-through / sink.

# --- Shared-module bootstrap ------------------------------------------------
# Nodes in this pack are loaded one-file-at-a-time by the extension's dynamic
# loader (importlib.util.spec_from_file_location), which registers each file
# under a synthetic "<package>.nodes.<stem>" name WITHOUT importing any parent
# package: package-relative imports therefore cannot work here. Instead we put
# this directory on sys.path and import the shared module absolutely, so every
# node resolves the SAME module instance (one ANY_TYPE singleton pack-wide).
