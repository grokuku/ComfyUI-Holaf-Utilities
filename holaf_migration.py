# === Holaf Utilities - Legacy Data Migration ===
#
# One-shot automatic migration triggered at the very beginning of package
# initialisation (before the database, cache, config or temp directories are
# opened anywhere else). It handles the rename of the extension folder
# (ComfyUI-Holaf-Utilities -> ComfyUI-AI-Helper) without any perceived data
# loss for the user.
#
# Two zones are migrated:
#   Zone A - artefacts living INSIDE the extension folder (relative to the
#            location of this file): database (+ WAL/SHM), thumbnail cache,
#            config.ini, temp upload/export dirs. The source is a sibling
#            folder named "ComfyUI-Holaf-Utilities".
#   Zone B - the per-user data root under ComfyUI/user/default/
#            ("ComfyUI-Holaf-Utilities" -> "AI-Helper").
#
# Safety rules:
#   - MOVE (rename) instead of copy+delete whenever possible (atomic on the
#     same filesystem, no duplicated disk space).
#   - NEVER overwrite newer data already present at the destination: on
#     conflict the NEW side is kept and the OLD side is left untouched
#     (no merge, no deletion).
#   - NEVER delete the legacy folder itself: the user cleans it up manually.
#   - Each individual move is wrapped in its own try/except so one failure
#     never blocks the others.
#   - Idempotent: once artefacts have been moved (or left as conflicts), the
#     next startup finds nothing to do and stays completely silent.
